# CS445-FinalProject
final Project yall.
# To Build
This project runs on netbeans, so there is already a netbeans project file inside. All you have to do is go into your netbeans IDE, Open Project, and
locate the folder CS445-FinalProject in this repo. Everything should be set and ready to go. If you wish to build the project yourself, without all
of the crazy netbeans stuff, let me know and I'll change it up.
